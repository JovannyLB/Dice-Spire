        "Why did I create this website? Well, at around <i>October 2021</i> I started using <b>TaleSpire</b> as an interactive virtual tabletop/battle map for my online homebrew campaign, but I was deeply and utterly flabbergasted by the fact that you couldn't roll dice with modifiers in the tool, so it became quite a chore for my group to have to <i>Alt+Tab</i> to roll their dice on external tools, every time something happened in combat. When I found out about DiceURLs, I knew there were going to be community tools to solve my problem, but there weren't that many, so I decided to dust off my website making skills and make a tool myself, and thus, <b>Dice Spire</b> was born.",
